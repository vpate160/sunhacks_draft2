# ü§ñ GraphRAG: AI-Powered Research Assistant

GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines the power of your knowledge graph with Large Language Models to provide intelligent, context-aware answers to research questions.

## üéØ What is GraphRAG?

Instead of simple keyword search, GraphRAG:
- **Understands context** using the graph structure
- **Reasons across connections** to find related papers
- **Generates insights** based on the entire research landscape
- **Provides semantic search** that understands meaning, not just words

## üöÄ How to Use GraphRAG

### 1. Access the GraphRAG Interface
- Click the "Ask AI" button in the main application
- The GraphRAG panel opens on the right side

### 2. Ask Natural Language Questions

**Example Queries:**
```
"What research has been done on microgravity effects on bone density?"
"How does space radiation affect cellular processes?"
"What are the connections between stem cell research and space medicine?"
"Show me papers about plant growth in weightless conditions"
"What research gaps exist in space biology?"
```

### 3. Explore Results Intelligently

Each query returns:
- **Relevant Papers**: Ranked by semantic similarity
- **AI Insights**: Generated summaries and research opportunities
- **Key Themes**: Clickable concepts for further exploration
- **Connection Reasoning**: Why papers are related
- **Graph Context**: Visual representation of result relationships

## üß† Advanced Features

### Semantic Search
- Understands synonyms and related concepts
- Finds papers even if they don't contain exact keywords

## üìä Query Examples & Results

### Example 1: "microgravity bone research"

**What GraphRAG finds:**
- Papers directly mentioning microgravity and bone
- Related papers about weightlessness effects
- Connected research on calcium metabolism
- Studies on osteoblast/osteoclast activity in space

**AI Insights:**
- "Research shows consistent bone loss patterns in microgravity"
- "Key mechanisms involve altered cellular signaling pathways"
- "Potential countermeasures focus on mechanical loading"

### Example 2: "stem cell space applications"

**Graph Reasoning Process:**
1. Find papers with "stem cell" concepts
2. Expand to connected papers about "space" or "microgravity"
3. Include papers studying "regeneration" in space contexts
4. Add papers connected through shared authors/concepts

**Result Types:**
- Direct stem cell space research
- Regenerative medicine in microgravity
- Tissue engineering applications
- Connected cellular biology studies

### Concept Network
- Interactive concept exploration
- Related concept discovery
- Research pathway visualization
- Semantic clustering

## üí° Best Practices

### Writing Effective Queries
‚úÖ **Good:** "How does microgravity affect bone metabolism?"
‚ùå **Less Effective:** "bone"

‚úÖ **Good:** "What are the connections between plant biology and space research?"
‚ùå **Less Effective:** "plants space"

### Exploring Results
1. **Start Broad:** Ask general questions first
2. **Drill Down:** Click concepts to explore specific areas
3. **Follow Connections:** Use graph structure to discover related work
4. **Check Insights:** Read AI-generated summaries for key findings

### Understanding Relevance
- **High Scores (80%+):** Direct matches to your query
- **Medium Scores (50-80%):** Conceptually related research
- **Lower Scores (30-50%):** Connected through graph relationships
